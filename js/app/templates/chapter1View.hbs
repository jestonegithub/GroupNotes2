<div class="section_title">1.1 The "Marvelous" Proof</div>

<p><span class="first_Letter">I</span>t's hard to imagine how a 3 day lecture on mathematics, covering the topics of
    "Modular forms", "elliptic curves" and "Galois representations" could have built to a suspenseful climax. But according to
    Amir Azcel's telling of the story, that's exactly what happened. In his book <i>Fermat's Last Theorem:
        Unlocking the Secret of an Ancient Mathematical Problem</i>, Azcel describes how Andrew Wiles had arrived
    at a conference in Cambridge to give three one hour lectures in June of 1993. At the end of his first day of lecturing, Wiles
    had proved an impressive result, but he still had two lectures left to give. At the end of day two few still
    had any idea that his lectures were building towards something momentous. But there was sufficient curiosity among
    his fellow mathematicians that when the time for his third and final lecture came, Wiles had to push through a crowd of folks
    to get to the front of the room. It wasn't until the end of the third lecture that everyone in attendence &#8212;
    and soon the whole world &#8212; came to understand what Wiles had done. He had just given a proof of Fermat's Last Theorem, arguably the most
    infamous unsolved problem in all of mathematics at that time.</p>

<p>As a 10 year old boy, Wiles had learned about the famous problem that Pierre de Fermat had written into the margins of his copy of <i>Arithmetica</i>
    in 1637:</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter_body_wide">

<div>It is impossible to separate a cube into two cubes, or a fourth power into two fourth powers,
    or in general, any power higher than the second, into two like powers. I have discovered a
    truly marvelous proof of this, which this margin is too narrow to contain.</div>

</div>

<div class="chapter_body">

    <p>In modern notation, Fermat's Last Theorem states that the equation</p>
    <p id="fermat_eq_chpt1">$$x^n + y^n = z^n$$</p>
    <p>has no non-trivial solutions in $\mathbb{Z}$ for $n \geq $ 3.</p>

<p>If you stare at this equation long enough, and if you have the right sort of intellectual bent,
    you just might find yourself wondering how to prove the damn thing. If you are insufficiently
    experienced with equations like it, found in the field of Diophantine Geometry, you might also
    find yourself wondering how it possibly took mathematicians 350 years to solve. It is, after all,
    just an equation. An equation with only <i>three</i> variables.</p>

<p> At this point you might be tempted to take a peak at Wiles proof &#8212; to learn the "trick" that
    finally fell the beast. The good news is that it's rather easy to track down a copy of the
    proof online. The bad news is, and I hate to be the one to break it to you my dear reader,
    the proof is over 200 pages long. And what's worse, each of
    those pages is a minefield of technical definitions and theorems that could take even the best
    graduate students weeks or months to digest.</p>

    <p> The proof isn't a nod to the idea of mathematical elegance - it's a monstrosity. And, if we are being frank,
the result itself (that is, the statement of the theorem) isn't event something most mathematicians care about. Carl Friedrich Gauss,
        arguably the greatest mathematician of all time, once wrote</p>

        <p id="gauss_quote1"><i>I confess that Fermatâ€™s Theorem as an isolated proposition has very little interest for me, because I could easily
            lay down a multitude of such propositions, which one could neither prove nor dispose of.</i></p>

    <p> So why should anyone care about Fermat's Last Theorem? Why bother reading (for you), or writing (for me),
        a "Field Guide" to a highly technical proof for a result that holds little interest to most professional mathematicians?
        Because I believe that this "monstrous" proof provides an opportunity. To see how even something as unremarkable as Fermat's
        "theorem" could give rise to an emergent order so interesting and complicated that over three centuries to untangle.</p>

    <p> Going forward then, we look at FLT not as a destination, but as both a starting point and an end point -
        something that nudges us on our way and also pulls us forward on a strange journey. We must
        not expect to encounter some great treasure buried deep in the heart of a jungle, some key to
        seeing the whole thing differently - but instead we encounter the jungle itself in all its majesty.</p>

    <p> It should go without saying that at the end of this journey we won't emerge mathematicians anymore than someone
        who takes apart a car to study its pieces is a mechanic. But we will have, at least, what the physicist Richard Feynman
        referred to as the <i>pleasure of finding things out</i>.</p>

<div class="section_title">1.2 Preliminary Observations</div>

    <p>It seems worthwhile to stop, before proceeding in the footsteps of others, and think for a few moments about Fermat's "equation."
    What might we say about it, if we'd only just laid eyes on the thing a few moments ago?</p>


    <p>The first point to make about Fermat's Last Theorem is that it is obviously untrue for $n = 2$.
        We know this because every student is taught in their first course in geometry about the many whole number solutions of
        the Pythagorean Theorem, which is exactly Fermat's equation with $n = 2$. These so-called <i>Pythagorean Triples</i> include, for example,
        $(3,4,5)$, since

        $$3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2 $$ </p>

   <p> Now knowing nothing more than basic algebra and the existence of the triple $(3,4,5)$ we are in a position to prove the following result.<p>


    <div class="math_result"><div class="result_title">Observation 1.1</div> The Pythagorean equation $x^2 + y^2 = z^2$ has an infinite number of non-trivial solutions in $\mathbb{Z}$.</div>

    <div class="math_proof"><span class="proof_title">Proof</span>

         We know that $(3,4,5)$ is a solution to this equation. That is

        $$3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2 $$

        Let's now multiply the entire equation by $n^2$

        $$ n^2 3^2 + n^2 4^2 = n^2 5^2 $$

        Which we can rewrite as

        $$ (3n)^2 + (4n)^2 = (5n)^2 $$

        In other words, $(3n,4n,5n)$ is also a solution to the equation, for any $n$. In fact, this holds for all $n$, so we have our infinite
        set of solutions.

        <span class="qed_tag">Q.E.D.</span>

    </div>


    <p> What was the point of this little exercise? Well, one thing to note is how easy it is to prove that there are
        an infinite number of solutions if you already have one to work with. The same argument we applied here for $n=2$
        will work for any $n$. But as we shall see, proving that these same equations have no solutions for a particular $n$ is hard.
        It's nontrivial, if still "elementary" to prove this is so for $n=4$. It's less elementary to prove it for $n=3$.
        For a certain class of primes known as 'regular primes' it becomes more challenging, requiring the machinery of abstract
        algebra. For the remaining primes it requires a lot of machinery from what we now think of is arithmetic geometry -
        a field of study that requires students to spend years studying topics in number theory, algebraic geometry, and
        algebraic number theory.</p>
